# ChatApp_IO
This is simple chat app. It is constructed by using Express node.js and socket.io.
Socket.IO is a JavaScript library for realtime web applications. It enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts; a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for Node.js.
Socket.io can be installed with the npm tool in the directory where the chatApp is locally present in the machine.
